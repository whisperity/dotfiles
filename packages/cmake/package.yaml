description: CMake is a cross-platform open-source build system designed to
  generate build tooling invocations (such as for 'make' and 'ninja') based on
  build instructions written in a common DSL. It also allows for extensive
  modularisation and automatic finding of environment dependencies, etc.
dependencies:
  - basic
  - internal.virtualenv
prepare:
  - action: shell all
    commands:
      - "bash -c 'source $SESSION_DIR/dotfiles-venv/bin/activate; pip install bs4 lxml'"
      - "bash -c 'source $SESSION_DIR/dotfiles-venv/bin/activate; $PACKAGE_DIR/select-latest-version.py > $TEMPORARY_DIR/url.txt'"
      - "wget \"$(cat $TEMPORARY_DIR/url.txt)\" -O cmake.tar.gz"
      - "tar -xf cmake.tar.gz"
      - "mv cmake-* cmake"
install:
  - action: make dirs
    dirs:
      - $HOME/bin
      - $HOME/opt
  - action: copy tree
    dir: $TEMPORARY_DIR/cmake
    to: $HOME/opt/cmake
  - action: shell
    command: "cd $HOME/bin; ln -s ../opt/cmake/bin/* ."
uninstall:
  - action: shell
    command: "cd $HOME/bin; for sl in $(ls ../opt/cmake/bin); do rm -f ${sl}; done"
